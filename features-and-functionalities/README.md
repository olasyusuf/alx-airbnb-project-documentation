### Project Requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend

<br />

#### Objective:

**Identifying and documenting the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend** by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

<br />

---

#### Introduction to Project Requirements

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the **Airbnb Clone project**, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements outlined below are categorized into **Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements**, and **Non-Functional Requirements**.

<br />

#### Core Functionalities

The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

**1. User Management**

  - **User Registration**:
      - Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
      - Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  - **User Login and Authentication**:
      - Implement login via email and password.
      - Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
  - **Profile Management**:
      - Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

**2. Property Listings Management**

  - **Add Listings**:
    - Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
    
  - **Edit/Delete Listings**:
    - Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

**3. Search and Filtering**

  - Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:
    - Location
    - Price range
    - Number of guests
    - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
    - Include pagination for large datasets.

**4. Booking Management**

  - **Booking Creation**:
    - Guests can book a property for specified dates.
    - Prevent double bookings using date validation.
  
  - **Booking Cancellation**:
    - Allow guests or hosts to cancel - bookings based on the cancellation policy.
  - **Booking Status**:
    - Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

**5. Payment Integration**

  - Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
    - Upfront payments by guests.
    - Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
  - Include support for multiple currencies.

**6. Reviews and Ratings**

  - Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
  - Hosts can respond to reviews.
  - Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

**7. Notifications System**

  - Implement email and in-app notifications for:
    - Booking confirmations
    - Cancellations
    - Payment updates

**8. Admin Dashboard**

  - Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
  - Users
  - Listings
  - Bookings
  - Payments

<br />

#### Technical Requirements

**1. Database Management**

  - Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
  - Required tables:
    - Users (guests and hosts)
    - Properties
    - Bookings
    - Reviews
    - Payments

**2. API Development**

  - Use **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
  -  Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
     - GET (retrieve data)
     - POST (create data)
     - PUT/PATCH (update data)
     - DELETE (remove data)
     - Use **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

**3. Authentication and Authorization**

  - Use JWT for secure user sessions.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
    - Guests
    - Hosts
    - Admins

**4. File Storage (Scenario based)**

  - Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**. For implementation, we will use file storage

**5. Third-Party Services**

  - Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

**6. Error Handling and Logging**

  - Implement global error handling for APIs.

<br />

#### Non-Functional Requirements
**1. Scalability**
  - Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
  - Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

**2. Security**
  - Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
  - Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

**3. Performance Optimization**
  - Use **caching** tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
  - Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

**4. Testing**
  - Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
  - Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
